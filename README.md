##
iâ€™m a python dev who loves solving problems that don't need to be solved. iâ€™m also super into c programming, especially when it comes to signal synthesis and low-level stuff!

right now, iâ€™m focused on learning **making clean, efficient and memory-safe code**, and always looking for new ways to chime in, learn and contribute to open-source projects.

i also love old hardware like the commodore 64 and similar, and i freaking LOVE the sid chip.


## ðŸš€ what i do:
- **languages**: python, c
- **version control**: git, github
- **os**: linux, windows


## ðŸ“š what i might be working on:
- building a **python discord bot** called **mostlycute**. the name should tell you enough!! 
- working on some **clean c programming practices** to get better at memory-safe programming!
