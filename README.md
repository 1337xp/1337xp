# 1337xp
I guess you have found my Github profile...   
Anyways, hello! I like to work on stuff that doesn't make sense at all.   
   
I usually write almost all of my projects in Python, sometimes others too.

### I guess if you want to know me a little more:
I like working on electronics, I'm a diehard fire alarm and siren enthusiast, and I like working on old computers way too much...   

If you see me around on Discord, don't be afraid to say hi lol
